Main:
    Locate venue
    If venue is known
        Enter augment mode
    Else
        Enter explore mode

Locate venue:
    Find all venues in GPS area
    Take N seconds of video
    Perform binary search over frames:
        Optimize for frames with highest number of SURF features
    Take SURF features from best frame
    For possible venues
        Get bayesian likelihood based on SURF features
    Order venues by likelihood and user's history
    If most likely venue is outlier
        Assume it is correct, or ask user to confirm
    Else
        Present user list of venues, in order of likelihood

Augment Mode:
    Download highest-quality landmarks
    Localize camera
    Loop
        If venue has changed
            Re-enter main
        Capture augment frame
        Process augment frame
        Add augments to frame
        Display frame
    On exit
        Upload observations and pose

Download highest-quality landmarks:
    For each local map:
        Take N landmarks with highest hit/miss ratio
    Collect all N landmarks for each M maps
    Return unique best-guess landmark positions

Localize Camera:
    Frame = venue-locating frame,
    Extract SURF features from frame
    Locate match on server
    If match
        Initialize pose and return
    Else
        Repeat with frame taken from camera

Process augment frame:
    Prediction
    Observation
    Update

Prediction:
    Apply dynamic model to pose to get prior
    Choose landmarks to attempt to observe
    Project landmarks with their uncertainty
    Warp landmark patches based on pose

Choose landmarks to attempt to observe:
    Use nearby landmarks visible in frustum
    Choose top N (>= 4) with highest hit/miss ratio
    Hit/miss ratio is weighted from server to local,
      such that local quickly becomes more important

Observation:
    Scan uncertainty ellipses for warped patches using ZNCC
    Record hits/misses
    If hits < MIN (= 4)
        Repeat Predict/Observe for remaining
    Record accel / gyro / etc

Update:
    Apply EKF
    record new pose and uncertainty
